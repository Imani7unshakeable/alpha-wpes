2. Checking File and Directory Permissions:It checks the permissions of critical files and directories to identify any improper or weak permissions that could pose security risks.

3. Checking Registry Key Permissions: Alpha-wpes examines the permissions of important registry keys to identify any weak or insecure permissions that may need attention.

4. Finding Password Files: The tool checks for the existence of password files in specific locations on the system.

5. Checking Firewall Configuration: It retrieves and displays the configuration of the Windows firewall.
